% npx @bazel/create nodejs_rule_example       
npx: installed 2 in 2.519s
Creating Bazel workspace nodejs_rule_example...
Successfully created new Bazel workspace at /home/jack/nodejs_rule_example
Next steps:
  1. cd nodejs_rule_example
  2. npm install
  3. npm run build
     Note that there is nothing to build, so this trivially succeeds.
  4. Add contents to the BUILD.bazel file or create a new BUILD.bazel in a subdirectory.
